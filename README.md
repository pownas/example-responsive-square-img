 A thing that needs to be solved

## What needs to be solved in this repo?
This is the problem I have, all the images that are in portrait and landscape-mode, needs to be shown as squares:

What it should look like (only 1:1 images), but with the images from first example:

The code from Image1 and Image2 (needs to be changed in css or html to show squares and be responsive...) :

## Test2 ([index2.html](https://github.com/pownas/example-responsive-square-img/blob/main/index2.html) and [style2.css](https://github.com/pownas/example-responsive-square-img/blob/main/style2.css#L13-L17))
Result when on 100% desktop width (looks good):
